# Password Vault

In a world where data breaches and hacking occur regularly, it is extremely important to use long, random, strong passwords unique to each service you sign up for to protect your data. It is very difficult to accomplish this as it is difficult to memorize truely random passwords for the multitude of services that a person will sign up for in their lifetime. Password vault is a tool designed to aid in keeping each account secure. Just remember a single strong password!

Password vault hashes all user data locally so your plaintext private information will never be visible online. Currently Password Vault is 100% offline using SQLite, all user data stays local to your computer and is not uploaded anywhere.
